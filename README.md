# VEXT-HVT (Venice Unleashed High Value Target)



HVT or High Value Target is a gametype re-created for Venice Unleashed where the only objective is to defend or kill the high value target.

# New Gametype!

  - 2 teams fight to the death attempting to kill the HVT
  - Defences will be powerful with limited ammo
  - Attackers will have ragtag weapons but unlimited attempts to attempt to kill the HVT
  - You died? Don't leave, you get bonus for whomever you are spectating ranging from health boosts, more ammo, or even in certain cases explosives!


Starting:
  - Attackers start with basic weapons and full ammunition
  - Attackers also have unlimited waves, it's up to the HVT's squad and the rest of the team to keep the HVT alive for the time limit (currently 5m)
  - Defense will have more defender explosives, mines, claymores, and also have more accurate and powerful weapons.
  - Each time someone in the defense dies they are switched to the attacking team
  - If an attacker dies, they are forced to spectate a player, but then have the ability to "gift" special abilities to those attackers who are still alive.
